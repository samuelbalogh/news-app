It’s real design generation, not image generation.<p>What it does:<p>Describe what you want (e.g. “modern poster for a coffee brand”)<p>AI builds a layout around your content and image<p>Edit and refine everything in the browser<p>Export for web, print, or campaigns<p>Why we built it:\nDesign shouldn’t be locked behind complex tools or templates.

    "body": "Hey HN! Ilya and Nikita here. We're building wispbit (<a href=\"https://wispbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wispbit.com</a>) - a tool that helps keep codebase standards alive.<p>With the help of AI coding tools, engineers are writing more code than ever. Code output has increased, but the tooling to manage this hasn't improved. Background agents still write bad code, and your IDE still writes slop without the right context.<p>So we built wispbit. It works by scanning your codebase for patterns you already use, and coming up with rules. Rules are kept up to date as standards change, and you can edit rules any time.<p>You can enforce these rules during code review, and because we have this rules system, you can run a CLI locally to review using these rules. You can think of it as a portable rules file that you can bring anywhere.<p>We put a lot of work into making a system that produces good rules and avoids slop. For repository crawling, we have an agent that dispatches subagents, similar to Anthropic's research agent. These subagents will go through and look for common patterns within modules and directories, and report back to the main agent, which synthesizes the results. We also do a historical scan on your pull request comments, determine which ones were addressed, filter out comments that wouldn't make a good rule, and use that to create or update rules.<p>Our early users are seeing 80%+ resolution rates, meaning that 80% of comments that wispbit makes are resolved.<p>Long-term, we see ourselves being a validation layer for AI-written code. With tools like Devin and Cursor, we find ourselves having to re-prompt the same solution many times. We still don't know the long-term implications on AI-assisted codebases, so we want to get in front of that as soon as possible.<p>We've opened up signups for free to HN folks at <a href=\"https://wispbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wispbit.com</a>.

    "body": "Hey HN! I'm José, and I built Recall to solve a problem that was driving me crazy.<p>The Problem:\nI use Claude for coding daily, but every conversation starts from scratch. I'd explain my architecture, coding standards, past decisions... then hit the context limit and lose everything. Next session? Start over.<p>The Solution:\nRecall is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives Claude persistent memory using Redis + semantic search. Think of it as long-term memory that survives context limits and session restarts.<p>How it works:\n- Claude stores important context as \"memories\" during conversations\n- Memories are embedded (OpenAI) and stored in Redis with metadata\n- Semantic search retrieves relevant memories automatically\n- Works across sessions, projects, even machines (if you use cloud Redis)<p>Key Features:\n- Global memories: Share context across all projects\n- Relationships: Link related memories into knowledge graphs\n- Versioning: Track how memories evolve over time\n- Templates: Reusable patterns for common workflows\n- Workspace isolation: Project A memories don't pollute Project B<p>Tech Stack:\n- TypeScript + MCP SDK\n- Redis for storage\n- OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)\n- ~189KB bundle, runs locally<p>Current Stats:\n- 27 tools exposed to Claude\n- 10 context types (directives, decisions, patterns, etc.)\n- Sub-second semantic search on 10k+ memories\n- Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, any MCP client<p>Example Use Case:\nI'm building an e-commerce platform. I told Claude once: \"We use Tailwind, prefer composition API, API rate limit is 1000/min.\" Now every conversation, Claude remembers and applies these preferences automatically.<p>What's Next (v1.6.0 in progress):\n- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions\n- Docker support for easy deployment\n- Proper test suite with Vitest\n- Better error messages and logging<p>Try it:<p>npm install -g @joseairosa/recall\n# Add to claude_desktop_config.json\n# Start using persistent memory",

We just launched MARS, a general-purpose robot with an open onboard agentic OS built on top of ROS2.<p>Overview: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GEOMYDXv6pE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/GEOMYDXv6pE</a><p>Control demo: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_Cw5fGa8i3s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/_Cw5fGa8i3s</a><p>Videos of autonomous use-cases: <a href=\"https://docs.innate.bot/welcome/mars-example-use-cases\">https://docs.innate.bot/welcome/mars-example-use-cases</a><p>Quickstart: <a href=\"https://docs.innate.bot/welcome/mars-quick-start\">https://docs.innate.bot/welcome/mars-quick-start</a>.<p>Our last thread: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42451707\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42451707</a><p>When we started we felt there is currently no good affordable general-purpose that anyone can build on. There’s no lack of demand: hugging face’s SO-100 and LeKiwi are pretty clear successes already; but the hardware is unreliable, the software experience is barebone and keeps changing, and you often need to buy hidden extras to make them work (starting with a computer with a good gpu). The Turtlebots were good, but are getting outdated.<p>The open-source hobbyist movement lacks really good platforms to build on, and we wanted something robust and accessible. MARS is our attempt at making a first intuitive AI robot for everyone.<p>What it is:<p>- It comes assembled and calibrated<p>- Has onboard compute with a jetson orin nano 8gb<p>- a 5DoF arm with a wrist camera<p>- Sensors: RGBD wide-angle cam, 2D LiDAR, speakers<p>- Control via a dedicated app and a leader arm that plugs in iPhone and Android<p>- 2 additional USB ports + GPIO pins for extra sensors or effectors.<p>- And our novel SDK called BASIC that allows to run it like an AI agent with VLAs.<p>It boots in a minute, can be controlled via phone, programmable in depth with a PC, and the onboard agent lets it see, talk, plan, and act in real-time.<p>Our SDK BASIC allows to create “behaviors” (our name for programs) ranging from a simple hello world to a very complex long-horizon task involving reasoning, planning, navigation and manipulation. You can create skills that behaviors can run autonomously by training the arm or writing code tools, like for an AI agent.<p>You can also call the ROS2 topics to control the robot at a low-level. And anything created on top of this SDK can be easily shared with anyone else by just sharing the files.<p>This is intended for hobbyist builders and education, and we would love to have your feedback!<p>p.s. If you want to try it, there’s a temporary code HACKERNEWS-INNATE-MARS that lowers the price to $1,799.<p>p.p.s The hardware and software will be open-sourced too, if some of you want to contribute or help us prepare it properly feel free to join our discord at <a href=\"https://discord.gg/YvqQbGKH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/YvqQbGKH</a>",

    "title": "Launch HN: LlamaFarm (YC W22) – Open-source framework for distributed AI",
    "body": "Hi HN! We're Rob, Matt, and Rachel from LlamaFarm (<a href=\"https://llamafarm.dev\">https://llamafarm.dev</a>). We're building an open-source AI framework based on a simple belief: the future isn't one massive model in the cloud—it's specialized models running everywhere, continuously fine-tuned from real usage.<p>The problem: We were building AI tools and kept falling into the same trap. AI demos die before production. We built a bunch of AI demos but they were impossible to get to production.  It would work perfectly on our laptop, but when we deployed it, something broke, and RAG would degrade. If we were running our own model, it would quickly become out of date. The proof-of-concept that impressed the team couldn't handle real-world data.<p>Our solution: declarative AI-as-code. One YAML defines models, policies, data, evals, and deploy. Instead of one brittle giant, we orchestrate a Mixture of Experts—many small, specialized models you continuously fine-tune from real usage. With RAG for source-grounded answers, systems get cheaper, faster, and auditable.<p>There’s a short demo here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7MHGyN0MdQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7MHGyN0MdQ</a> and a more in-depth one at  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnZ4iaOSJ4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNnZ4iaOSJ4</a>.<p>Ultimately, we want to deliver a single, signed bundle—models + retrieval + database + API + tests—that runs anywhere: cloud, edge, or air-gapped. No glue scripts. No surprise egress bills. Your data stays in your runtime.<p>We believe that the AI industry is evolving like computing did. Just as we went from mainframes to distributed systems and monolithic apps to microservices, AI is following the same path: models are getting smaller and better. Mixture of Experts is here to stay. Qwen3 is sick. Llama 3.2 runs on phones. Phi-3 fits on edge devices. Domain models beat GPT-5 on specific tasks.<p>RAG brings specialized data to your model: You don't need a 1T parameter model that \"knows everything.\" You need a smart model that can read <i>your</i> data. Fine-tuning is democratizing: what cost $100k last year now costs $500. Every company will have custom models.<p>Data gravity is real: Your data wants to stay where it is: on-prem, in your AWS account, on employee laptops.<p>Bottom line: LlamaFarm turns AI from experiments into repeatable, secure releases, so teams can ship fast.<p>What we have working today: Full RAG pipeline: 15+ document formats, programmatic extraction (no LLM calls needed), vector-database embedding, universal model layer that runs the same code for 25+ providers, automatic failover, cost-based routing; Truly portable: Identical behavior from laptop → datacenter → cloud; Real deployment: Docker Compose works now with Kubernetes basics and cloud templates on the way.<p>Check out our readme/quickstart for easy install instructions: <a href=\"https://github.com/llama-farm/llamafarm?tab=readme-ov-file#-quickstart-tldr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/llama-farm/llamafarm?tab=readme-ov-file#-...</a><p>Or just grab a binary for your platform directly from the latest release:\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/llama-farm/llamafarm/releases/latest\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/llama-farm/llamafarm/releases/latest</a><p>The vision is to be able to run, update, and continuously fine-tune dozens of models across environments with built-in RAG and evaluations, all wrapped in a self-healing runtime. We have an MVP of that today (with a lot more to do!).<p>We’d love to hear your feedback! Think we’re way off? Spot on? Want us to build something for your specific use case? We’re here for all your comments!",

    "body": "Hi HN! We built Grapevine (<a href=\"https://getgrapevine.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://getgrapevine.ai</a>), a knowledge search system for AI agents that connects Slack, GDrive, Notion, codebases, and more. Our first app is a company GPT that significantly outperforms existing alternatives.<p>Anyone can setup a Grapevine Slack bot and have it respond to and optionally proactively answer questions that require company context. Here’s a demo video with examples: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_nrfbZzvxU8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/_nrfbZzvxU8</a><p>We built Grapevine because we were interested in a ChatGPT that fully understands your company. We'd tried many of the existing tools (including expensive enterprise ones), but while they were good at answering “what is X team’s Q4 goal,” they weren’t good at the day-to-day questions that actually blocked people.<p>So, our founders and early engineers created a set of 100+ representative questions, from hard technical questions to company-specific knowledge questions. At first, the state-of-the-art “enterprise search” products were getting about 50% of them correct, and our in-house system was getting 35%. But as we solved details in data processing, search algorithm, and more, we eventually achieved 85%. (For reference, the best human score our founders got was 70%)<p>It’s changed the way we work: popular engineering channels that have 5+ questions / day are fully answered proactively by AI, and people across departments go to the bot first for bug reports, incidents, and support tickets. Dozens of our beta customers have been consistently surprised by the quality of the answers, too.<p>Security is obviously super important for a product like this. We will never train on your data. In addition, your data is encrypted at rest, in an isolated database from other customers, and the system is SOC 2 compliant with regularly scheduled pen tests. We built it to Gather’s (<a href=\"https://gather.town/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gather.town/</a>) SOC 2 Type II standards - that’s the original virtual office product we launched (and still maintain) out of YC, but we’ve since pivoted to Grapevine.<p>We put a lot of effort into making Grapevine easy to set up. You can try it now, for free, at <a href=\"https://getgrapevine.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://getgrapevine.ai</a>",

We built Sculptor because we wanted a great UI for parallel coding agents.<p>We love Claude Code, but wanted to solve some of the problems that come from running multiple agents in parallel (ex: merge conflicts with multiple agents, reinstalling dependencies with git worktrees, Claude Code could deleting your home directory, etc).<p>Sculptor is a desktop app that lets you safely run Claude Code agents by putting them in separate docker containers. This lets you use Claude without having to compromise on security or deal with annoying tool permission prompts. Then you can just tell Claude to keep running the code until it actually works.<p>To help you easily work with containerized agents, we created “Pairing Mode”: bidirectionally sync the agent’s code into your IDE and test/edit together in real time. You can also simply pull and push manually if you want.<p>We have some more cool features planned on our roadmap that are enabled by this approach, like the ability to “fork” conversations (and the entire state of the container), or roll back to a previous state.<p>It’s still very early, but we would love your feedback.<p>Sculptor itself is free to use, so please try it out and let us know what you think!",

You describe what you're trying to find. The agent figures out how to structure the data and where to look, then searches, extracts the results, and outputs everything in a CSV you can export.<p>We've set up a special no-signup version for the HN community at <a href=\"https://hn.webhound.ai\">https://hn.webhound.ai</a> - just click \"Continue as Guest\" to try it without signing up.<p>Here's a demo: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fGaRfPdK1Sk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/fGaRfPdK1Sk</a><p>We started building it after getting tired of doing this kind of research manually.

It worked, but sessions routinely cost over $1100 and it would often get lost in infinite loops. We knew that wasn't sustainable, so we started building around smaller models.<p>That meant adding more structure. We introduced a multi-agent system to keep it reliable and accurate. There's a main agent, a set of search agents that run subtasks in parallel, a critic agent that keeps things on track, and a validator that double-checks extracted data before saving it. We also gave it a notepad for long-term memory, which helps avoid duplicates and keeps track of what it's already seen.<p>After switching to Gemini 2.5 Flash and layering in the agent system, we were able to cut costs by more than 30x while also improving speed and output quality.<p>The system runs in two phases. First is planning, where it decides the schema, how to search, what sources to use, and how to know when it's done. Then comes extraction, where it executes the plan and gathers the data.<p>It uses a text-based browser we built that renders pages as markdown and extracts content directly. We tried full browser use but it was slower and less reliable. Plain text still works better for this kind of task.<p>We also built scheduled refreshes to keep datasets up to date and an API so you can integrate the data directly into your workflows.<p>Right now, everything stays in the agent's context during a run. It starts to break down around 1000-5000 rows depending on the number of attributes. We're working on a better architecture for scaling past that.<p>We'd love feedback, especially from anyone who's tried solving this problem or built similar tools. Happy to answer anything in the thread.<p>Thanks!\nMoe",

    "body": "Hey HN! We are Klavis AI (<a href=\"https://www.klavis.ai/\">https://www.klavis.ai/</a>) and we're launching Strata, one open-source MCP server that helps AI agents use thousands of API tools without getting overwhelmed. Instead of showing all available tools at once, Strata reveals them step-by-step based on what the AI actually needs.<p>As a former Senior SWE on Google Gemini 's tool use team, I saw firsthand how AI would struggle with tools. If you've built AI agents, you've likely hit the same walls: (1) AI agents struggle to pick the right API from hundreds of options. (2) Tool descriptions and info consume massive token budgets. (3) Most servers cap at 40~50 tools to avoid these problems, limiting what you can build.<p>Instead of flooding the AI with everything upfront, Strata works like a human would. It guides the AI agents to discover relevant categories, then lists available actions in those categories. It relies on LLMs’ reasoning to drill down progressively to find the exact tool needed. Here are some examples:<p><i>Github query: \"Find my stale pull requests in our main repo\"</i><p>Strata: AI model identifies GitHub → Shows categories (Repos, Issues, PRs, Actions) → AI selects PRs → Shows PR-specific actions -> AI selects list_pull_requests → Shows  list_pull_requests details -> Executes list_pull_requests with the right parameters.<p><i>Jira query: \"Create a bug ticket in the 'MOBILE' project about the app crashing on startup.\"</i><p>Strata: AI identifies Jira → Shows categories (Projects, Issues, Sprints) → AI selects Issues → Shows actions (create_issue, get_issue) → AI selects create_issue → Shows create_issue details → Executes with correct parameters.<p><i>Slack query: \"Post a message in the #announcements channel that bonus will be paid out next Friday.\"</i><p>Strata: AI identifies Slack → Shows categories (Channels, Messages, Users) → AI selects Messages → Shows actions (send_message, schedule_message) → AI selects send_message → Shows send_message details → Executes with correct parameters.<p>This progressive approach unlocks a huge advantage: depth. While most integrations offer a handful of high-level tools, Strata can expose hundreds of granular features for a single app like GitHub, Jira, etc. Your AI agent can finally access the deep, specific features that real workflows require, without getting lost in a sea of options.<p>Under the hood, Strata manages authentication tokens and includes a built-in search tool for the agent to dig into documentation if it gets stuck.<p>On the MCPMark <a href=\"https://mcpmark.ai/leaderboard/mcp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mcpmark.ai/leaderboard/mcp</a>, Strata achieves +15.2% higher pass@1 rate vs the official GitHub server and +13.4% higher pass@1 rate vs the official Notion server. In human eval tests, it hits 83%+ accuracy on complex, real-world multi-app workflows.<p>Here is a quick demo to watch Strata navigate a complex workflow with multiple apps, automatically selecting the right tools at each step: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N00cY9Ov_fM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N00cY9Ov_fM</a>.<p>You can connect to any external MCP Server into Strata, and we have an open source version for it: <a href=\"https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis</a>.<p>For team or production use with more features, visit our website: <a href=\"https://www.klavis.ai\">https://www.klavis.ai</a>. Add Strata to Cursor, VS Code or any MCP-compatible application with one click. You can also use our API to easily plug in Strata to your AI application.<p>We look forward to your comments.

    "title": "strata: one mcp server for ai tools",
    "body": "Hey HN! We are Klavis AI (<a href=\"https://www.klavis.ai/\">https://www.klavis.ai/</a>) and we're launching Strata, one open-source MCP server that helps AI agents use thousands of API tools without getting overwhelmed. Instead of showing all available tools at once, Strata reveals them step-by-step based on what the AI actually needs.<p>As a former Senior SWE on Google Gemini 's tool use team, I saw firsthand how AI would struggle with tools. If you've built AI agents, you've likely hit the same walls: (1) AI agents struggle to pick the right API from hundreds of options. (2) Tool descriptions and info consume massive token budgets. (3) Most servers cap at 40~50 tools to avoid these problems, limiting what you can build.<p>Instead of flooding the AI with everything upfront, Strata works like a human would. It guides the AI agents to discover relevant categories, then lists available actions in those categories. It relies on LLMs’ reasoning to drill down progressively to find the exact tool needed. Here are some examples:<p><i>Github query: \"Find my stale pull requests in our main repo\"</i><p>Strata: AI model identifies GitHub → Shows categories (Repos, Issues, PRs, Actions) → AI selects PRs → Shows PR-specific actions -> AI selects list_pull_requests → Shows  list_pull_requests details -> Executes list_pull_requests with the right parameters.<p><i>Jira query: \"Create a bug ticket in the 'MOBILE' project about the app crashing on startup.\"</i><p>Strata: AI identifies Jira → Shows categories (Projects, Issues, Sprints) → AI selects Issues → Shows actions (create_issue, get_issue) → AI selects create_issue → Shows create_issue details → Executes with correct parameters.<p><i>Slack query: \"Post a message in the #announcements channel that bonus will be paid out next Friday.\"</i><p>Strata: AI identifies Slack → Shows categories (Channels, Messages, Users) → AI selects Messages → Shows actions (send_message, schedule_message) → AI selects send_message → Shows send_message details → Executes with correct parameters.<p>This progressive approach unlocks a huge advantage: depth. While most integrations offer a handful of high-level tools, Strata can expose hundreds of granular features for a single app like GitHub, Jira, etc. Your AI agent can finally access the deep, specific features that real workflows require, without getting lost in a sea of options.<p>Under the hood, Strata manages authentication tokens and includes a built-in search tool for the agent to dig into documentation if it gets stuck.<p>On the MCPMark <a href=\"https://mcpmark.ai/leaderboard/mcp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mcpmark.ai/leaderboard/mcp</a>, Strata achieves +15.2% higher pass@1 rate vs the official GitHub server and +13.4% higher pass@1 rate vs the official Notion server. In human eval tests, it hits 83%+ accuracy on complex, real-world multi-app workflows.<p>Here is a quick demo to watch Strata navigate a complex workflow with multiple apps, automatically selecting the right tools at each step: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N00cY9Ov_fM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N00cY9Ov_fM</a>.<p>You can connect to any external MCP Server into Strata, and we have an open source version for it: <a href=\"https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis</a>.<p>For team or production use with more features, visit our website: <a href=\"https://www.klavis.ai\">https://www.klavis.ai</a>. Add Strata to Cursor, VS Code or any MCP-compatible application with one click. You can also use our API to easily plug in Strata to your AI application.<p>We look forward to your comments. Thanks for reading!",
